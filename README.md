# Mini-Projects Showcase

Welcome to the Mini-Projects Showcase! ðŸš€

## Overview

As a frontend engineer, I believe in continuous learning and hands-on practice. This repository serves as my daily playgroundâ€”a space where I explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through bite-sized projects. Each mini-project represents a focused exercise, allowing me to sharpen my skills, experiment with new techniques, and express creativity.

## What to Expect
- **Diverse Topics:** From responsive layouts to interactive widgets, I cover a wide range of topics.
- **Clean Code:** I strive for clean, maintainable code. You'll find well-structured HTML, thoughtful CSS, and efficient JavaScript.
- **Learning Notes:** Alongside each project, I share insights, challenges, and lessons learned.
